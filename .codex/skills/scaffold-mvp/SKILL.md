  short-description: Scaffold repo + docs + schemas + minimal Python package
---

You will:
1) Create the directory structure in the repository root as defined in README.
2) Add all markdown docs under /docs exactly as specified.
3) Create placeholder Python modules under tenderfit/ with __init__.py, cli.py, app.py.
4) Add schemas/ JSON schema files with placeholders matching docs.
5) Add pyproject.toml and .env.example.
6) Do not implement features; only scaffold cleanly.
